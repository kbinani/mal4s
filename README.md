We forked the excellent effort from Andrew Caudwell called "gource" which was created for a different purpose (software version control visualization). The reason for our fork instead of contributing to the original repo is that the features we have added wouldn't be suitable for the original purpose. As Mal4s users we bow to Andrew and will be eternally grateful for his original creation that made Mal4s possible and his magnanimous decision to release gource with the GPLicense.

Sponsoring open source development makes good things happen for everybody: Comcast funded this development from the [Tech Fund](http://techfund.comcast.com). This effort is also made possible by the sustaining customers of [Dissect Cyber](http://dissectcyber.com/).
