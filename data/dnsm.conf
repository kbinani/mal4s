# GUIDE TO FIELD POSITIONS
# plotter	Malware name
# host		FQDN that was looked up such as my.example.com
# tld		All characters to the right of last dot in host
#
# FIELDS STARTING WITH b CAUSE BRANCHING OF LINES
# All of the IP address related fields are about the IP of the resolver
# that was queried
# b1		RIR such as arin, ripe, et al from IP whois
# b2		Two letter country code from IP whois
# b3		ipv4 1st octet
# b4		ipv4 2nd octet
# b5		ipv4 3rd octet
# b6		ipv4 4th octet
# b7		authoritative name server host for my.example.com
# b8		Company name that IP address netblock is allocated to
#
# FIELDS STARTING WITH n HAVE NO BRANCHING EFFECT
# n1		Name of png to display for the plotter, such as a two letter country code
#		n1 works if you have a /flags/ dir with us.png, fr.png etc for every country code
# n2		reverse DNS of the IP address
# n3		registrar
# n4		registration date of domain queried about
# n5		Port the resolver was contacted on
# n6		DNS Resource Record (RR) type requested
# n7		Returned status of the DNS request
# n9		MD5 hash of the malware binary which produced the above network activity when executed
